# KairoAPI

**KairoAPI** is a modular, extensible project management API built in Go. It includes full authentication, task and project management and a scalable architecture to support future features like idea capture, collaboration and planning flows.

This is more than a basic task manager. KairoAPI is designed as a backend foundation for building real-world tools like productivity apps, knowledge systems and team project platforms.
